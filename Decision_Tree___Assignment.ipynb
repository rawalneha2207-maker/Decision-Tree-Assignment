        "This leads to clearer decision rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Reduces Uncertainty\n",
        "\n",
        "High Information Gain means a large drop in entropy, so the model becomes more confident in predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Improves Model Accuracy\n",
        "\n",
        "Better splits early in the tree often result in higher classification accuracy and simpler trees.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Makes the Tree Efficient\n",

        "\n",
        "Key Notes\n",
        "\n",
        "Information Gain is mainly used with Entropy (ID3, C4.5 algorithms).\n",
        "\n",
        "It can be biased toward features with many unique values.\n",
        "\n",

        "Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "Information Gain measures how much a split improves class purity.\n",
        "It is crucial because it ensures the decision tree chooses features that most effectively reduce uncertainty, leading to accurate and interpretable classification models."
